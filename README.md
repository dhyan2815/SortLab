# 📊 SortLab
A modern, interactive web application that allows users to **visualize, compare, and analyze various sorting algorithms** in real time.  
The project combines *algorithmic* logic, smooth data visualizations, and performance analytics in a clean, *minimal*, and educational interface.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Interactive Sorting Visualizer** – Choose from Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort.
- **Custom Input** – Enter your own comma-separated data and visualize the sorting process step by step.
- **Dynamic Execution** – Run and observe sorting behavior with real-time animations and metrics.

### Visualization & Analysis
- **Smooth Animations** – Easy-paced transitions with natural easing for clarity and engagement.
- **Performance Metrics** – Automatically measures **runtime** and **memory usage** for each algorithm.
- **Dynamic Complexity Table** – Generates Best, Average, and Worst case complexities per run.
- **Programmatic Flowcharts** – Auto-generated diagrams showing the logic and flow of each algorithm.
- **Downloadable CSV Results** – Includes time, memory, and complexity data in a clean tabular format.

###  Educational Components
- **Multi-language Code Viewer** – View each algorithm implemented in **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**.
- **About Page** – Learn definitions, purposes, and real-world use cases of sorting algorithms.

###  Technical & Design Features
- **Tech Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js  
- **Visualization:** D3.js / Chart.js  
- **Theme:** Dark mode with cyan (`#00FFFF`) accents  
- **Fonts:** Poppins (headings) & Inter (body)  
- **Responsive:** Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices  
- **UX:** Smooth transitions, minimal design, and easy navigation

## How It Works

1. User selects a **sorting algorithm** from the dropdown.  
2. Inputs a list of **numbers** (comma-separated).  
3. On clicking **Sort Data**, the visualization animates each step of the chosen algorithm.  
4. The site measures **execution time** and **memory usage** in real time.  
5. A comparison table and flowchart are **dynamically** generated.  
6. Results can be downloaded as a **CSV file** for analysis.
